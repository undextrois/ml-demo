Machine Learning Demo Application
==========================================================================================

Description:
    An interactive terminal application demonstrating four fundamental categories of 
    machine learning through hands-on, educational examples:

      1. Supervised Learning (Binary Classification)
            - Logistic Regression on the breast cancer dataset
            - Goal: Predict malignant vs. benign tumors

      2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
            - K-Means clustering on the iris flower dataset
            - Goal: Discover natural groupings without using original labels

      3. Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
            - Teach an agent to solve the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium
            - Goal: Learn via trial and error to maximize cumulative reward

      4. Semi-Supervised Learning
            - Label propagation with partially-labeled iris data
            - Goal: Use a small fraction of labeled data to infer labels on unlabeled samples

Features:
    - Textual user interface with explanations at every step
    - Walkthrough of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluating, and interpretation
    - Robust error handling and library availability checks
    - Educational notes and detailed metric reporting

Requirements:
    - Python 3.7 or later
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - gymnasium OR gym (for reinforcement learning demo)
    - (All dependencies are open-source and can be installed via pip)

    To install requirements:
      pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn gymnasium

      # If gymnasium is not available, gym can be used instead for RL part:
      pip install gym

Usage:
    Run the application from the terminal:

        python ml-demo.py

    Navigate the menu using numbers 1-5 to select the demo or exit.
    Each demo will display progress, metrics, and conceptual explanations.

Educational Purpose:
    This script is intended for teaching and demonstration of core ML approaches.
    It is not intended for production use. Please consult the official documentation of libraries
    and research best practices for real-world machine learning projects.

Remember: Each type of ML solves different problems:
   ‚Ä¢ Supervised: Learn from labeled examples
   ‚Ä¢ Unsupervised: Find hidden patterns in data
   ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement: Learn through trial and error
   ‚Ä¢ Semi-supervised: Learn from mixed labeled/unlabeled data
